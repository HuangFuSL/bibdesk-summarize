## Highlights

* üìéJust attach the PDFs to the BibDesk entry and ensure the "annote" field to be empty.
* ‚öôÔ∏èThe script will automatically summarize the papers and fill the "annote" field with the summary, once the editor window is closed.

# Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Copy ALL the files in `src` to your BibDesk scripts directory, usually `~/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/Scripts/`.
3. Edit the `ai_summarize.py` file to set up your access to LLM services.
4. Add the `ai_summarize.apple` script to "Close Editor Window" hook in `BibDesk > Preferences > Script Hooks`.

Once you have set up the script, you can use it by:

1. Open an entry in BibDesk and attach the PDF file to it.
2. Ensure the "annote" field is empty.
3. Close the editor window.
4. Wait until the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è in the menu bar disappears.

The first launch may take a while as it sets up the environment and downloads necessary packages. Subsequent launches will be faster.
