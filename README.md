# Usage

Assume all the commands are executed in the root directory of the repository.

## AppleScript Automation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Edit the `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY` and `MODEL_NAME` line in the `ai_summarize.py` file to set up your access to LLM services.
3. Execute `cp src/ai_summarize.* ~/Library/Application\ Support/BibDesk/Scripts/` to install the script files.
4. Add the `ai_summarize.applescript` to the "Close Editor Window" hook in `BibDesk > Preferences > Script Hooks`.

## TeX Preview

1. Execute `mkdir -p $(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME)/bibtex/bst` to create the necessary directory.
2. Execute `cp src/acm-annote.bst $(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME)/bibtex/bst/` to install the bibtex style file.
3. Execute `cp src/previewtemplate.tex ~/Library/Application\ Support/BibDesk/` to override the default preview template.
4. In BibDesk, go to `Preferences > Preview`, first enable "Generate previews using TeX", and then change the "Full path to pdflatex" to `/Library/TeX/texbin/xelatex`.

Once you have set up the script, you can use it by:

1. Open an entry in BibDesk and attach the PDF file to it.
2. Ensure the "annote" field is empty.
3. Close the editor window.
4. Wait until the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è in the menu bar disappears.
5. Click on the "TeX Preview" button in the BibDesk entry to view the summary.

The first launch may take a while as it sets up the environment and downloads necessary packages. Subsequent launches will be faster.
